	abstract = {The design of automated negotiators has been the focus of abundant research in recent years. However, due to difficulties involved in creating generalized agents that can negotiate in several domains and against human counterparts, many automated negotiators are domain specific and their behavior cannot be generalized for other domains. Some of these difficulties arise from the differences inherent within the domains, the need to understand and learn negotiators{\textquoteright} diverse preferences concerning issues of the domain, and the different strategies negotiators can undertake. In this paper we present a system that enables alleviation of the difficulties in the design process of general automated negotiators termed Genius, a General Environment for Negotiation with Intelligent multi-purpose Usage Simulation. With the constant introduction of new domains, e-commerce and other applications, which require automated negotiations, generic automated negotiators encompass many benefits and advantages over agents that are designed for a specific domain. Based on experiments conducted with automated agents designed by human subjects using Genius we provide both quantitative and qualitative results to illustrate its efficacy. Finally, we also analyze a recent automated bilateral negotiators competition that was based on Genius. Our results show the advantages and underlying benefits of using Genius and how it can facilitate the design of general automated negotiators.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a general framework for multilateral turn-taking protocols and two fully specified protocols namely Stacked Alternating Offers Protocol (SAOP) and Alternating Multiple Offers Protocol (AMOP). In SAOP, agents can make a bid, accept the most recent bid or walk way (i.e., end the negotiation without an agreement) when it is their turn. AMOP has two different phases: bidding and voting. The agents make their bid in the bidding phase and vote the underlying bids in the voting phase. Unlike SAOP, AMOP does not support walking away option. In both protocols, negotiation ends when the negotiating agents reach a joint agreement or some deadline criterion applies. The protocols have been evaluated empirically, showing that SAOP outper- forms AMOP with the same type of conceder agents in a time-based deadline setting. SAOP was used in the ANAC 2015 competition for automated negotiating agents.},

abstract = "In recommender systems, human preferences are identified by a number of individual components with complicated interactions and properties. Recently, the dynamicity of preferences has been the focus of several studies. The changes in user preferences can originate from substantial reasons, like personality shift, or transient and circumstantial ones, like seasonal changes in item popularities. Disregarding these temporal drifts in modelling user preferences can result in unhelpful recommendations. Moreover, different temporal patterns can be associated with various preference domains, and preference components and their combinations. These components comprise preferences over features, preferences over feature values, conditional dependencies between features, socially-influenced preferences, and bias. For example, in the movies domain, the user can change his rating behaviour (bias shift), her preference for genre over language (feature preference shift), or start favouring drama over comedy (feature value preference shift). In this paper, we first propose a novel latent factor model to capture the domain-dependent component-specific temporal patterns in preferences. The component-based approach followed in modelling the aspects of preferences and their temporal effects enables us to arbitrarily switch components on and off. We evaluate the proposed method on three popular recommendation datasets and show that it significantly outperforms the most accurate state-of-the-art static models. The experiments also demonstrate the greater robustness and stability of the proposed dynamic model in comparison with the most successful models to date. We also analyse the temporal behaviour of different preference components and their combinations and show that the dynamic behaviour of preference components is highly dependent on the preference dataset and domain. Therefore, the results also highlight the importance of modelling temporal effects but also underline the advantages of a component-based architecture that is better suited to capture domain-specific balances in the contributions of the aspects.",

abstract={This paper presents an automated peer-to-peer (P2P) negotiation strategy for settling energy contracts among prosumers in a Residential Energy Cooperative (REC) considering heterogeneous prosumer preferences. The heterogeneity arises from prosumers' evaluation of energy contracts through multiple societal and environmental criteria and the prosumers' private preferences over those criteria. The prosumers engage in bilateral negotiations with peers to mutually agree on periodical energy contracts/loans that consist of an energy volume to be exchanged at that period and the return time of the exchanged energy. The prosumers keep an ordered preference profile of possible energy contracts by evaluating the contracts from their own valuations on the entailed criteria, and iteratively offer the peers contracts until an agreement is formed. A prosumer embeds the valuations into a utility function that further considers uncertainties imposed by demand and generation profiles. Empirical evaluation on real demand, generation and storage profiles illustrates that the proposed negotiation based strategy is able to increase the system efficiency (measured by utilitarian social welfare) and fairness (measured by Nash social welfare) over a baseline strategy and an individual flexibility control strategy. We thus elicit system benefits from P2P flexibility exchange already with few agents and without central coordination, providing a simple yet flexible and effective paradigm that may complement existing markets.},

The optimal deployment of different resources, such as local renewable energy production (RES), diesel generators (DG) and energy storage systems (ESS) may bring about significant financial gain for the organizer, and is usually framed as an off-grid or limited grid-connection problem. This makes online planning particularly challenging due to the uncertainty related to the RES production, constraints regarding the operation of the diesel generators and limitations of the grid connection. In this paper a new online planning algorithm based on two-stage stochastic programming is proposed in order to address the aforementioned challenges and provide minimal-cost, uninterrupted, and sustainable electrification of festivals under dynamically priced grid energy. Data based on real festival events are used in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

abstract="In this article, we introduce a new paradigm to achieve Pareto optimality in group decision-making processes: bottom-up approaches to Pareto optimality. It is based on the idea that, while resolving a conflict in a group, individuals may trust some members more than others; thus, they may be willing to cooperate and share more information with those members. Therefore, one can divide the group into subgroups where more cooperative mechanisms can be formed to reach Pareto optimal outcomes. This is the first work that studies such use of a bottom-up approach to achieve Pareto optimality in conflict resolution in groups. First, we prove that an outcome that is Pareto optimal for subgroups is also Pareto optimal for the group as a whole. Then, we empirically analyze the appropriate conditions and achievable performance when applying bottom-up approaches under a wide variety of scenarios based on real-life datasets. The results show that bottom-up approaches are a viable mechanism to achieve Pareto optimality with applications to group decision-making, negotiation teams, and decision making in open environments.",

abstract = {Classically, disciplines like negotiation and decision making have focused on reaching Pareto optimal solutions due to its stability and efficiency properties. Despite the fact that many practical and theoretical algorithms have successfully attempted to provide Pareto optimal solutions, they have focused on attempting to reach Pareto Optimality using horizontal approaches, where optimality is calculated taking into account every participant at the same time. Sometimes, this may prove to be a difficult task (e.g., conflict, mistrust, no information sharing, etc.). In this paper, we explore the possibility of achieving Pareto Optimal outcomes in a group by using a bottom-up approach: discovering Pareto optimal outcomes by interacting in subgroups. We analytically show that the set of Pareto optimal outcomes in a group covers the Pareto optimal outcomes within its subgroups. This theoretical finding can be applied in a variety of scenarios such as negotiation teams, multi-party negotiation, and team formation to social recommendation. Additionally, we empirically test the validity and practicality of this proof in a variety of decision making domains and analyze the usability of this proof in practical situations.},

  abstract  = {The digital economy is based on data sharing yet citizens have little control about how their personal data is being used. While data management during web and app-based use is already a challenge, as the Internet of Things (IoT) scales up, the number of devices accessing and requiring personal data will go beyond what a person can manually assess in terms of data access requests. Therefore, new approaches are needed for managing privacy preferences at scale and providing active consent around data sharing that can improve fidelity of operation in alignment with user intent. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel agent-based approach to negotiate the permission to exchange private data between users and services. Our agent negotiates based on learned  preferences from actual users. To evaluate our agent-based approach, we developed an experimental tool to run on people's own smartphones, where users were asked to share their private, real data (e.g. photos, contacts, etc) under various conditions. The agent autonomously negotiates potential agreements for the user, which they can refine by manually continuing the negotiation. The agent learns from these interactions and updates the user model in subsequent interactions. We find that the agent is able to effectively capture the preferences and negotiate on the user's behalf but, surprisingly, does not reduce user engagement with the system. Understanding how interaction interplays with agent-based automation is a key component to successful deployment of negotiating agents in real-life settings and within the IoT context in particular.},

  abstract  = {Consider an agent that can autonomously negotiate and coordinate with others in our stead, to reach outcomes and agreements in our interest. Such automated negotiation agents are already common practice in areas such as high frequency trading, and are now finding applications in domains closer to home, which involve not only mere financial optimizations but balanced tradeoffs between multiple issues, such as cost and convenience. As a simple example, a smart thermostat controlling a heat pump could provide demand response to the electricity grid if the inconvenience is offset by the grid relieve incentives. In such situations, the agent represents a user with individual and a priori unknown preferences, which are costly to elicit due to the user bother this incurs. Therefore, the agent needs to strike a  balance between increasing the user model accuracy and the inconvenience caused by interacting with the user. To do so, we require a tractable metric for the value of information in an ensuing negotiation, which until now has not been available. In this paper, we propose a decision model that finds the point of diminishing returns for improving the model of user preferences with costly queries. We present a reasoning framework to derive this metric, and show a myopically optimal and tractable stopping criterion for querying the user before a fixed number of negotiation rounds. Our method provides an extensible basis for interactive negotiation agents to evaluate which questions are worth posing given the marginal utility expected to arise from more accurate beliefs.},

This poses a challenge, as efficient and effective negotiation requires the bidding agent to take the other's wishes and future behavior into account when deciding on a proposal. Therefore, in order to reach better and earlier agreements, an agent can apply learning techniques to construct a model of the opponent. There is a mature body of research in negotiation that focuses on modeling the opponent, but there exists no recent survey of commonly used opponent modeling techniques. This work aims to advance and integrate knowledge of the field by providing a comprehensive survey of currently existing opponent models in a bilateral negotiation setting. We discuss all possible ways opponent modeling has been used to benefit agents so far, and we introduce a taxonomy of currently existing opponent models based on their underlying learning techniques. We also present techniques to measure the success of opponent models and provide guidelines for deciding on the appropriate performance measures for every opponent model type in our taxonomy.},

To tackle this problem we propose iDR, an interactive system for generating personalised appliance usage scheduling recommendations that maximise savings and convenience with minimal intrusiveness. In particular, our system learns when to stop interacting with the user during the preference elicitation process, in order to keep the bother cost (e.g., the amount of time the user spends, or the cognitive cost of interacting) minimal. We demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluation on real-world data that our approach improves savings by up to 35\%, while maintaining a significantly lower bother cost, compared to state-of the-art benchmarks.},

In this paper, we present the preliminary results of a study that explores what happens when permission settings are more discretional at install time. We present the results of a pilot experiment, in which we ask users to negotiate which data they are happy to share, and we show that this results in higher user satisfaction than the typical take-it-or-leave-it setting.

Traditionally, negotiation is a necessary, but time-consuming and expensive activity.  Therefore, in the last two decades, there has been a growing interest in the automation of negotiation. One of the key challenges for a successful negotiation is that usually only limited information is available about the opponent.  Although sharing private information can result in mutual gains, negotiators often avoid this to prevent exploitation.  This problem can be partially overcome by deriving information from the opponent's actions. Exploiting this information to learn aspects of the opponent is called opponent modeling. Creating an accurate opponent model is a key factor in improving the quality of the outcome and can further increase the benefits of automated negotiation. Despite the advantages of opponent modeling and two decades of research, there is no recent study that provides an overview of the field. Therefore, in order to stimulate the development of efficient future opponent models, and to outline a research agenda, we provide an overview of existing opponent models in bilateral negotiation. As our main contributions, we classify opponent models using a comprehensive taxonomy and provide recommendations on how to select the best model depending on the negotiation setting.},

However, so far, there is no fundamental approach on how much to concede at every stage of the negotiation in such time-sensitive domains.

  abstract = {Negotiation is an important activity in human society, and is studied by various disciplines, ranging from economics and game theory, to electronic commerce, social psychology, and artificial intelligence. Traditionally, negotiation is a necessary, but also time-consuming and expensive activity. Therefore, in the last decades there has been a large interest in the automation of negotiation, for example in the setting of e-commerce. This interest is fueled by the promise of automated agents eventually being able to negotiate on behalf of human negotiators. Every year, automated negotiation agents are improving in various ways, and there is now a large body of negotiation strategies available, all with their unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, some agents are able to predict the opponent's preferences very well, while others focus more on having a sophisticated bidding strategy. The problem however, is that there is little incremental improvement in agent design, as the agents are tested in varying negotiation settings, using a diverse set of performance measures. This makes it very difficult to meaningfully compare the agents, let alone their underlying techniques. As a result, we lack a reliable way to pinpoint the most effective components in a negotiating agent. There are two major advantages of distinguishing between the different components of a negotiating agent's strategy: first, it allows the study of the behavior and performance of the components in isolation. For example, it becomes possible to compare the preference learning component of all agents, and to identify the best among them. Second, we can proceed to mix and match different components to create new negotiation strategies., e.g.: replacing the preference learning technique of an agent and then examining whether this makes a difference. Such a procedure enables us to combine the individual components to systematically explore the space of possible negotiation strategies. To develop a compositional approach to evaluate and combine the components, we identify structure in most agent designs by introducing the BOA architecture, in which we can develop and integrate the different components of a negotiating agent. We identify three main components of a general negotiation strategy; namely a bidding strategy (B), possibly an opponent model (O), and an acceptance strategy (A). The bidding strategy considers what concessions it deems appropriate given its own preferences, and takes the opponent into account by using an opponent model. The acceptance strategy decides whether offers proposed by the opponent should be accepted. The BOA architecture is integrated into a generic negotiation environment called Genius, which is a software environment for designing and evaluating negotiation strategies. To explore the negotiation strategy space of the negotiation research community, we amend the Genius repository with various existing agents and scenarios from literature. Additionally, we organize a yearly international negotiation competition (ANAC) to harvest even more strategies and scenarios. ANAC also acts as an evaluation tool for negotiation strategies, and encourages the design of negotiation strategies and scenarios. We re-implement agents from literature and ANAC and decouple them to fit into the BOA architecture without introducing any changes in their behavior. For each of the three components, we manage to find and analyze the best ones for specific cases, as described below. We show that the BOA framework leads to significant improvements in agent design by wining ANAC 2013, which had 19 participating teams from 8 international institutions, with an agent that is designed using the BOA framework and is informed by a preliminary analysis of the different components. In every negotiation, one of the negotiating parties must accept an offer to reach an agreement. Therefore, it is important that a negotiator employs a proficient mechanism to decide under which conditions to accept. When contemplating whether to accept an offer, the agent is faced with the acceptance dilemma: accepting the offer may be suboptimal, as better offers may still be presented before time runs out. On the other hand, accepting too late may prevent an agreement from being reached, resulting in a break off with no gain for either party. We classify and compare state-of-the-art generic acceptance conditions. We propose new acceptance strategies and we demonstrate that they outperform the other conditions. We also provide insight into why some conditions work better than others and investigate correlations between the properties of the negotiation scenario and the efficacy of acceptance conditions. Later, we adopt a more principled approach by applying optimal stopping theory to calculate the optimal decision on the acceptance of an offer. We approach the decision of whether to accept as a sequential decision problem, by modeling the bids received as a stochastic process. We determine the optimal acceptance policies for particular opponent classes and we present an approach to estimate the expected range of offers when the type of opponent is unknown. We show that the proposed approach is able to find the optimal time to accept, and improves upon all existing acceptance strategies. Another principal component of a negotiating agent's strategy is its ability to take the opponent's preferences into account. The quality of an opponent model can be measured in two different ways. One is to use the agent's performance as a benchmark for the model's quality. We evaluate and compare the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art opponent modeling techniques in negotiation. We provide an overview of the factors influencing the quality of a model and we analyze how the performance of opponent models depends on the negotiation setting. We identify a class of simple and surprisingly effective opponent modeling techniques that did not receive much previous attention in literature. The other way to measure the quality of an opponent model is to directly evaluate its accuracy by using similarity measures. We review all methods to measure the accuracy of an opponent model and we then analyze how changes in accuracy translate into performance differences. Moreover, we pinpoint the best predictors for good performance. This leads to new insights concerning how to construct an opponent model, and what we need to measure when optimizing performance. Finally, we take two different approaches to gain more insight into effective bidding strategies. We present a new classification method for negotiation strategies, based on their pattern of concession making against different kinds of opponents. We apply this technique to classify some well-known negotiating strategies, and we formulate guidelines on how agents should bid in order to be successful, which gives insight into the bidding strategy space of negotiating agents. Furthermore, we apply optimal stopping theory again, this time to find the concessions that maximize utility for the bidder against particular opponents. We show there is an interesting connection between optimal bidding and optimal acceptance strategies, in the sense that they are mirrored versions of each other. Lastly, after analyzing all components separately, we put the pieces back together again. We take all BOA components accumulated so far, including the best ones, and combine them all together to explore the space of negotiation strategies. We compute the contribution of each component to the overall negotiation result, and we study the interaction between components. We find that combining the best agent components indeed makes the strongest agents. This shows that the component-based view of the BOA architecture not only provides a useful basis for developing negotiating agents but also provides a useful analytical tool. By varying the BOA components we are able to demonstrate the contribution of each component to the negotiation result, and thus analyze the significance of each. The bidding strategy is by far the most important to consider, followed by the acceptance conditions and finally followed by the opponent model. Our results validate the analytical approach of the BOA framework to first optimize the individual components, and then to recombine them into a negotiating agent.}

  abstract  = {The design of automated negotiators has been the focus of abundant
	research in recent years. However, due to difficulties involved in
	creating generalized agents that can negotiate in several domains
	and against human counterparts, many automated negotiators are domain
	specific and their behavior cannot be generalized for other domains.
	Some of these difficulties arise from the differences inherent within
	the domains, the need to understand and learn negotiators' diverse
	preferences concerning issues of the domain, and the different strategies
	negotiators can undertake. In this paper we present a system that
	enables alleviation of the difficulties in the design process of
	general automated negotiators termed Genius, a General Environment
	for Negotiation with Intelligent multi-purpose Usage Simulation.
	With the constant introduction of new domains, e-commerce and other
	applications, which require automated negotiations, generic automated
	negotiators encompass many benefits and advantages over agents that
	are designed for a specific domain. Based on experiments conducted
	with automated agents designed by human subjects using Genius we
	provide both quantitative and qualitative results to illustrate its
	efficacy. Finally, we also analyze a recent automated bilateral negotiators
	competition that was based on Genius. Our results show the advantages
	and underlying benefits of using Genius and how it can facilitate
	the design of general automated negotiators.},

We apply sequential decision techniques to find analytical solutions that optimize the expected utility of the bidder, given certain strategy sets of the opponent. Our solutions turn out to significantly outperform current state of the art approaches in terms of obtained utility.

  abstract	 = {CP-nets have proven to be an effective representation for capturing preferences. However, their use in automated negotiation is not straightforward because, typically, preferences in CP-nets are partially ordered and negotiating agents are required to compare any two outcomes based on a request and an offer in order to negotiate effectively. If agents know how to generate total orders from their CP-nets, they can make this comparison. This paper proposes heuristics that enable the use of CP-nets in utility-based negotiations by generating total orderings. To validate this approach, the paper compares the performance of CP-nets with our heuristics with the performance of UCP-nets that are equipped with complete preference orderings. Our results show that we can achieve comparable performance in terms of the outcome utility. More importantly, one of our proposed heuristics can achieve this performance with significantly smaller number of interactions compared to UCP-nets.}

  abstract = {We consider automated negotiation as a process carried out by software
	agents to reach a consensus. To automate negotiation, we expect agents
	to understand their user's preferences, generate offers that will
	satisfy their user, and decide whether counter offers are satisfactory.
	For this purpose, a crucial aspect is the treatment of preferences.
	An agent not only needs to understand its own user's preferences,
	but also its opponent's preferences so that agreements can be reached.
	Accordingly, this paper proposes a learning algorithm that can be
	used by a producer during negotiation to understand consumer's needs
	and to offer services that respect consumer's preferences. Our proposed
	algorithm is based on inductive learning but also incorporates the
	idea of revision. Thus, as the negotiation proceeds, a producer can
	revise its idea of the consumer's preferences. The learning is enhanced
	with the use of ontologies so that similar service requests can be
	identified and treated similarly. Further, the algorithm is targeted
	to learning both conjunctive as well as disjunctive preferences.
	Hence, even if the consumer's preferences are specified in complex
	ways, our algorithm can learn and guide the producer to create well-targeted
	offers. Further, our algorithm can detect whether some preferences
	cannot be satisfied early and thus consensus cannot be reached. Our
	experimental results show that the producer using our learning algorithm
	negotiates faster and more successfully with customers compared to
	several other algorithms.},

Despite their diversity, there is a common structure to their design. A negotiation agent comprises three key components: the bidding strategy, the opponent model and the acceptance criteria. We show that this three-component view of a negotiating architecture not only provides a useful basis for developing such agents but also provides a useful analytical tool. By combining these components in varying ways, we are able to demonstrate the contribution of each component to the overall negotiation result, and thus determine the key contributing components. Moreover, we are able to study the interaction between components and present detailed interaction effects. Furthermore, we find that the bidding strategy in particular is of critical importance to the negotiator's success and far exceeds the importance of opponent preference modeling techniques. Our results contribute to the shaping of a research agenda for negotiating agent design by providing guidelines on how agent developers can spend their time most effectively.},

  abstract = {When a negotiating agent is presented with an offer by its opponent,
	it is faced with a decision: it can accept the offer that is currently
	on the table, or it can reject it and continue the negotiation. Both
	options involve an inherent risk: continuing the negotiation carries
	the risk of forgoing a possibly optimal offer, whereas accepting
	runs the risk of missing out on an even better future offer. We approach
	the decision of whether to accept as a sequential decision problem,
	by modeling the bids received as a stochastic process. We argue that
	this is a natural choice in the context of a negotiation with incomplete
	information, where the future behavior of the opponent is uncertain.
	We determine the optimal acceptance policies for particular opponent
	classes and we present an approach to estimate the expected range
	of offers when the type of opponent is unknown. We apply our method
	against a wide range of opponents, and compare its performance with
	acceptance mechanisms of state-of-the-art negotiation strategies.
	The experiments show that the proposed approach is able to find the
	optimal time to accept, and improves upon widely used existing acceptance
	mechanisms.},

  abstract  = {When two agents settle a mutual concern by negotiating with each other,they usually do not share their preferences so as to avoid exploitation. In such a setting, the agents may need to analyze each other's behavior to make an estimation of the opponent's preferences. This process of opponent modeling makes it possible to find a satisfying negotiation outcome for both parties. A large number of such opponent modeling techniques have already been introduced, together with different measures to assess their quality. The quality of an opponent model	can be measured in two different ways: one is to use the agent's performance as a benchmark for the model's quality, the other is to directly evaluate its accuracy by using similarity measures. Both methods have been used extensively, and both have their distinct	advantages and drawbacks. In this work we investigate the exact relation between the two, and we pinpoint the measures for accuracy that best predict performance gain. This leads us to new insights in how to	construct an opponent model, and what we need to measure when optimizing performance.},

	In such a setting, the agents may need to analyze each other's behavior

	of opponent modeling makes it possible to find a satisfying negotiation
	outcome for both parties. A large number of such opponent modeling
	techniques have already been introduced, together with different
	measures to assess their quality. The quality of an opponent model
	can be measured in two different ways: one is to use the agent's
	performance as a benchmark for the model's quality, the other is
	to directly evaluate its accuracy by using similarity measures. Both
	methods have been used extensively, and both have their distinct
	advantages and drawbacks. In this work we investigate the exact relation
	between the two, and we pinpoint the measures for accuracy that best

  abstract    = {In every negotiation with a deadline, one of the negotiating parties
	has to accept an offer to avoid a break off. A break off is usually
	an undesirable outcome for both parties, therefore it is important
	that a negotiator employs a proficient mechanism to decide under
	which conditions to accept. When designing such conditions one is
	faced with the acceptance dilemma: accepting the current offer may
	be suboptimal, as better offers may still be presented. On the other
	hand, accepting too late may prevent an agreement from being reached,
	resulting in a break off with no gain for either party. Motivated
	by the challenges of bilateral negotiations between automated agents
	and by the results and insights of the automated negotiating agents
	competition (ANAC), we classify and compare state-of-the-art generic
	acceptance conditions. We focus on decoupled acceptance conditions,
	i.e. conditions that do not depend on the bidding strategy that is
	used. We performed extensive experiments to compare the performance
	of acceptance conditions in combination with a broad range of bidding
	strategies and negotiation domains. Furthermore we propose new acceptance
	conditions and we demonstrate that they outperform the other conditions
	that we study. In particular, it is shown that they outperform the
	standard acceptance condition of comparing the current offer with
	the offer the agent is ready to send out. We also provide insight
	in to why some conditions work better than others and investigate
	correlations between the properties of the negotiation environment
	and the efficacy of acceptance conditions.},

	parties rely on each other to make concessions. The willingness to
	concede also depends in large part on the opponent. A concession
	by the opponent may be reciprocated, but the negotiation process
	may also be frustrated if the opponent does not concede at all. This
	process of concession making is a central theme in many of the classic
	and current automated negotiation strategies. In this paper, we present
	a quantitative classification method of negotiation strategies that
	measures the willingness of an agent to concede against different
	types of opponents. The method is then applied to classify some well-known
	negotiating strategies, including the agents of ANAC 2010. It is
	shown that the technique makes it easy to identify the main characteristics
	of negotiation agents, and can be used to group negotiation strategies
	into categories with common negotiation characteristics. We also
	observe, among other things, that different kinds of opponents call
	for a different approach in making concessions.},

When Binmore began his experimental work in the 1980s, conventional wisdom held that game theory would not work in the laboratory, but Binmore and other pioneers established that game theory can often predict the behavior of experienced players very well in favorable laboratory settings. The case of human bargaining behavior is particularly challenging for game theory. Everyone agrees that human behavior in real-life bargaining situations is governed at least partly by considerations of fairness, but what happens in a laboratory when such fairness considerations supposedly conflict with game-theoretic predictions? Behavioral economists, who emphasize the importance of other-regarding or social preferences, sometimes argue that their findings threaten traditional game theory. Binmore disputes both their interpretations of their findings and their claims about what game theorists think it reasonable to predict. Binmore's findings from two decades of game theory experiments have made a lasting contribution to economics. These papers--some coauthored with other leading economists, including Larry Samuelson, Avner Shaked, and John Sutton--show that game theory does indeed work in favorable laboratory environments, even in the challenging case of bargaining.},

	in a qualitative rather than quantitative way. Useful representations
	of qualitative preference orderings form an important component of
	automated decision tools. We propose a graphical representation of
	preferences that reflects conditional dependence and independence
	of preference statements under a ceteris paribus (all else being
	equal) interpretation. Such a representation is often compact and
	arguably quite natural in many circumstances. We provide a formal
	semantics for this model, and describe how the structure of the network
	can be exploited in several inference tasks, such as determining

	As hypothesized, high time pressure produced nonagreements and poor
	negotiation outcomes only when negotiators adopted an individualistic
	orientation; when negotiators adopted a cooperative orientation,
	they achieved high outcomes regardless of time pressure. In combination
	with an individualistic orientation, time pressure produced greater
	competitiveness, firm negotiator aspirations, and reduced information
	exchange. In combination with a cooperative orientation, time pressure
	produced greater cooperativeness and lower negotiator aspirations.
	The main findings were seen as consistent with Pruitt's strategic-choice
	model of negotiation.},

	the effects of a computerized \{NSS\} on the outcomes of face-to-face

	of college students were involved in a simulated industrial bargaining
	scenario which tested the impact of computer support and conflict
	level on contract outcomes and negotiator attitudes. Three levels
	of computer support were compared: a comprehensive \{NSS\} (DSS component
	and an electronic communication component), \{DSS\} support only
	(no electronic communication component), and no computer support.
	The results showed that the \{DSS\} support was similar to the comprehensive
	\{NSS\} in improving the information processing aspects of the negotiation,
	such as joint outcomes, contract balance, and number of contract
	proposals. However, the comprehensive \{NSS\} had a wider spectrum
	of positive effects, impacting the socio-emotional aspects of the
	negotiation such as perceived satisfaction and negative climate as
	well as the information processing aspects. },

  volume = {142},
  pages = {205 - 237},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Automated negotiation is a key form of interaction in systems that
	are composed of multiple autonomous agents. The aim of such interactions
	is to reach agreements through an iterative process of making offers.
	The content of such proposals are, however, a function of the strategy
	of the agents. Here we present a strategy called the trade-off strategy
	where multiple negotiation decision variables are traded-off against
	one another (e.g., paying a higher price in order to obtain an earlier
	delivery date or waiting longer in order to obtain a higher quality
	service). Such a strategy is commonly known to increase the social
	welfare of agents. Yet, to date, most computational work in this
	area has ignored the issue of trade-offs, instead aiming to increase
	social welfare through mechanism design. The aim of this paper is
	to develop a heuristic computational model of the trade-off strategy
	and show that it can lead to an increased social welfare of the system.
	A novel linear algorithm is presented that enables software agents
	to make trade-offs for multi-dimensional goods for the problem of
	distributed resource allocation. Our algorithm is motivated by a
	number of real-world negotiation applications that we have developed
	and can operate in the presence of varying degrees of uncertainty.
	Moreover, we show that on average the total time used by the algorithm
	is linearly proportional to the number of negotiation issues under
	consideration. This formal analysis is complemented by an empirical
	evaluation that highlights the operational effectiveness of the algorithm
	in a range of negotiation scenarios. The algorithm itself operates
	by using the notion of fuzzy similarity to approximate the preference
	structure of the other negotiator and then uses a hill-climbing technique
	to explore the space of possible trade-offs for the one that is most
	likely to be acceptable. },

  abstract = {This paper studies bilateral multi-issue negotiation between self-interested
	autonomous agents. Now, there are a number of different procedures
	that can be used for this process; the three main ones being the
	package deal procedure in which all the issues are bundled and discussed
	together, the simultaneous procedure in which the issues are discussed
	simultaneously but independently of each other, and the sequential
	procedure in which the issues are discussed one after another. Since
	each of them yields a different outcome, a key problem is to decide
	which one to use in which circumstances. Specifically, we consider
	this question for a model in which the agents have time constraints
	( in the form of both deadlines and discount factors) and information
	uncertainty ( in that the agents do not know the opponent's utility
	function). For this model, we consider issues that are both independent
	and those that are interdependent and determine equilibria for each
	case for each procedure. In so doing, we show that the package deal
	is in fact the optimal procedure for each party. We then go on to
	show that, although the package deal may be computationally more
	complex than the other two procedures, it generates Pareto optimal
	outcomes ( unlike the other two), it has similar earliest and latest
	possible times of agreement to the simultaneous procedure ( which
	is better than the sequential procedure), and that it ( like the
	other two procedures) generates a unique outcome only under certain
	conditions ( which we define).},

	similar preferences over the implementation scheme and the conditions

	the existence of equilibrium even when both players have uncertain

	solution and determine conditions under which it is unique, symmetric,

	how an agent can exploit its available information to select an optimal
	strategy. Here, in particular, the optimal strategies are determined
	considering all possible ways in which time can effect negotiation.
	Moreover, we list the conditions for convergence when both agents

It replaces the p original variables by a smaller number, q, of derived variables, the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables. Often, it is possible to retain most of the variability in the original variables with q very much smaller than p. Despite its apparent simplicity, principal component analysis has a number of subtleties, and it has many uses and extensions. A number of choices associated with the technique are briefly discussed, namely, covariance or correlation, how many components, and different normalization constraints, as well as confusion with factor analysis. Various uses and extensions are outlined.},

  abstract = {(ABMP paper) A component-based generic agent architecture for multi-attribute
	(integrative) negotiation is introduced and its application is described
	in a prototype system for negotiation about cars, developed in cooperation
	with, among others, Dutch Telecom KPN. The approach can be characterized
	as cooperative one-to-one multi-criteria negotiation in which the
	privacy of both parties is protected as much as desired. We model
	a mechanism in which agents are able to use any amount of incomplete
	preference information revealed by the negotiation partner in order
	to improve the efficiency of the reached agreements. Moreover, we
	show that the outcome of such a negotiation can be further improved
	by incorporating a guessing heuristic, by which an agent uses the
	history of the opponent's bids to predict his preferences. Experimental
	evaluation shows that the combination of these two strategies leads
	to agreement points close to or on the Pareto-efficient frontier.
	The main original contribution of this paper is that it shows that
	it is possible for parties in a cooperative negotiation to reveal
	only a limited amount of preference information to each other, but
	still obtain significant joint gains in the outcome.},

	various negotiation situations and by developing formal constructs
	and theorems for determining the character of a negotiation situation.
	Key among these concepts is the notion of opposition. Although opposition
	is defined in terms of the utility functions, it is more fundamental
	in the sense that it is more intuitive to decision makers and can
	be used in contexts in which the parties' utilities are unknown or
	are partially known. The effects of various rationality assumptions
	on efficiency and their implications for negotiation support systems
	are discussed. We argue that the prescriptive/descriptive approach
	advocated by negotiation analysts lacks sufficient explanatory powers
	to be effectively used in negotiation support and that negotiation
	support systems should not constrain the parties to the set of efficient
	points.},

	New models for cooperative group design, which emphasize the parallel
	interaction of the design experts involved, are needed. A central
	issue in cooperative group design concerns how conflicts among different
	experts can be resolved as the design is being produced. This paper
	proposes a model for how such conflict resolution can take place,
	and describes the results of a study aimed at verifying and instantiating
	this model by examining conflict resolution among human experts in
	the domain of architectural design. The study yielded four main conclusions:
	(1) conflict resolution plays a central role in cooperative design,
	(2) a rich collection of domain-independent conflict resolution expertise
	can be identified, (3) we need to represent the design rationale
	to support conflict resolution, and (4) knowledge acquisition in
	cooperative design presents special challenges and requires special

 abstract = {Abstract Electronic Marketplaces (EMs) can offer a number of advantages
	for users searching for products. In EMs, Intelligent Agents (IAs)
	can undertake the responsibility of representing buyers and sellers
	and negotiate over the conclusion of purchases. For this purpose,
	a negotiation is held between IAs. The most important characteristics
	are the deadline and the pricing strategy. The strategy defines the
	proposed prices at every round of the negotiation. We focus on the
	buyer side. We study concurrent negotiations between a buyer and
	a set of sellers. In this setting, the buyer utilizes a number of
	threads. Each thread follows a specific strategy and adopts swarm
	intelligence techniques for achieving the optimal agreement. The
	Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted by each thread.
	Our architecture requires no central coordination. In real situations,
	there is absolutely no knowledge for the characteristics of the involved

Usually, a negotiation is necessary for the conclusion of the transaction. The conclusion is either positive (agreement) or negative (conflict). An efficient reasoning mechanism is necessary for players participating in negotiations. In this paper, we focus on the buyer side and propose two decision models based on the optimal stopping theory (OST). OST is proved to be very efficient in cases where an entity tries to find the time to stop a process with the aim of maximizing her utility. The outcome of the proposed decision method indicates whether the buyer stops a negotiation either by accepting the offer or continuing in the negotiation by rejecting it. In our models, we assume zero knowledge on the players' characteristics. Our proposed decision models do not require any complex modeling or any information provided by experts. Experimental results reveal the efficiency of each model and provide a comparison assessment with other research efforts.}

	The agent receives messages sent by its opponent, analyzes them and
	responds. It also initiates discussion on one or more parameters

	dispute between Canada and Spain indicate that the agent played at

	agents which can benefit from sharing a common resource or distributing
	a set of common tasks. We propose a strategic model of negotiation
	that takes the passage of time during the negotiation process itself
	into account. A distributed negotiation mechanism is introduced that
	is simple, efficient, stable, and flexible in various situations.
	The model considers situations characterized by complete as well
	as incomplete information, and ones in which some agents lose over
	time while others gain over time. Using this negotiation mechanism
	autonomous agents have simple and stable negotiation strategies that
	result in efficient agreements without delays even when there are
	dynamic changes in the environment.},

	strategies via their impact on the reservation price. The model is
	composed of three modules: single-threaded negotiations, synchronized
	multithreaded negotiations, and dynamic multithreaded negotiations.
	These three modules embody increased sophistication and complexity.
	The single-threaded negotiation model provides negotiation strategies
	without specifically considering outside options. The model of synchronized
	multithreaded negotiations builds on the single-threaded negotiation
	model and considers the presence of concurrently existing outside
	options. The model of dynamic multithreaded negotiations expands
	the synchronized multithreaded model by considering the uncertain
	outside options that may come dynamically in the future. Experimental
	analysis is provided to characterize the impact of outside options
	on the reservation price and thus on the negotiation strategy. The
	results show that the utility of a negotiator improves significantly
	if he/she considers outside options, and the average utility is higher
	when he/she considers both the concurrent outside options and the
	foresees future options},

  abstract = {Many tasks in day-to-day life involve interactions among several people.
	Many of these interactions involve negotiating over a desired outcome.
	Negotiation in and of itself is not an easy task, and it becomes
	more complex under conditions of incomplete information. For example,
	the parties do not know in advance the exact tradeoff of their counterparts
	between different outcomes. Furthermore information regarding the
	preferences of counterparts might only be elicited during the negotiation
	process itself. In this paper we propose a model for an automated
	negotiation agent capable of negotiating with bounded rational agents
	under conditions of incomplete information. We test this agent against
	people in two distinct domains, in order to verify that its model
	is generic, and thus can be adapted to any domain as long as the
	negotiators' preferences can be expressed in additive utilities.
	Our results indicate that the automated agent reaches more agreements
	and plays more effectively than its human counterparts. Moreover,
	in most of the cases, the automated agent achieves significantly
	better agreements, in terms of individual utility, than the human
	counterparts playing the same role.},

  journal  = {Decision Support Systems},
  year     = {2013},
  abstract = {Abstract Automated negotiation protocols represent a potentially powerful
	tool for problem solving in decision support systems involving participants
	with conflicting interests. However, the effectiveness of negotiation
	approaches depends greatly on the negotiation problem under consideration.
	Since there is no one negotiation protocol that clearly outperforms
	all others in all scenarios, we need to be able to decide which protocol
	is most suited for each particular problem. The goal of our work
	is to meet this challenge by defining a negotiation handbook, that
	is, a collection of design rules which allow us, given a particular
	negotiation problem, to choose the most appropriate protocol to address
	it. This paper describes our progress towards this goal, including
	a tool for generating a wide range of negotiation scenarios, a set
	of high-level metrics for characterizing how negotiation scenarios
	differ, a testbed environment for evaluating protocol performance
	with different scenarios, and a community repository which allows
	us to systematically record and analyze protocol performance data.

  title = {Theory of games and economic behavior},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  year = {1953},
  author = {Morgenstern, Oskar and Von Neumann, John},
  abstract = {The nature of the problems investigated and the techniques employed
	in this book necessitate a procedure which in many instances is thoroughly
	mathematical. The mathematical devices used are elementary in the
	sense that no advanced algebra, or calculus, etc., occurs. (With
	two, rather unimportant, exceptions: Part of the discussion of an
	example in 19.7. et sequ. and a remark in A.3.3. make use of some
	simple integrals.) Concepts originating in set theory, linear geometry
	and group theory play an important role, but they are invariably
	taken from the early chapters of those disciplines and are moreover
	analyzed and explained in special expository sections. Nevertheless
	the book is not truly elementary because the mathematical deductions
	are frequently intricate and the logical possibilities are extensively
	exploited. Thus no specific knowledge of any particular body of advanced
	mathematics is required. However, the reader who wants to acquaint
	himself more thoroughly with the subject expounded here, will have
	to familiarize himself with the mathematical way of reasoning definitely
	beyond its routine, primitive phases. The character of the procedures
	will be mostly that of mathematical logics, set theory and functional
	analysis. We have attempted to present the subject in such a form
	that a reader who is moderately versed in mathematics can acquire
	the necessary practice in the course of this study. We hope that
	we have not entirely failed in this endeavour. In accordance with
	this, the presentation is not what it would be in a strictly mathematical
	treatise. All definitions and deductions are considerably broader
	than they would be there. Besides, purely verbal discussions and
	analyses take up a considerable amount of space. We have in particular
	tried to give, whenever possible, a parallel verbal exposition for
	every major mathematical deduction. It is hoped that this procedure
	will elucidate in unmathematical language what the mathematical technique
	signifies-and will also show where it achieves more than can be done
	without it. ?!? In this, as well as in our methodological stand,
	we are trying to follow the best examples of theoretical physics.
	The reader who is not specifically interested in mathematics should
	at first omit those sections of the book which in his judgment are
	too mathematical. We prefer not to give a definite list of them,
	since this judgment must necessarily be subjective. However, those
	sections marked with an asterisk in the table of contents are most
	likely to occur to the average reader inthis connection. At any rate
	he will find that these omissions will little interfere with the
	comprehension of the early parts, although the logical chain may
	in the rigorous sense have suffered an interruption. As he proceeds
	the omissions will gradually assume a more serious character and
	the lacunae in the deduction will become more and more significant.
	The reader is then advised to start again from the beginning since
	the greater familiarity acquired is likely to facilitate a better
	understanding. },

	regression? What do the final results mean? How can two sets of data

	the results to be wrong? This review is designed to demystify nonlinear
	regression so that both its power and its limitations will be appreciated.},

  abstract = {Negotiation is essential in settings where autonomous agents have
	conflicting interests and a desire to cooperate. For this reason,
	mechanisms in which agents exchange potential agreements according
	to various rules of interaction have become very popular in recent
	years as evident, for example, in the auction and mechanism design
	community. However, a growing body of research is now emerging which
	points out limitations in such mechanisms and advocates the idea
	that agents can increase the likelihood and quality of an agreement
	by exchanging arguments which influence each other; states. This
	community further argues that argument exchange is sometimes essential
	when various assumptions about agent rationality cannot be satisfied.
	To this end, in this article, we identify the main research motivations
	and ambitions behind work in the field. We then provide a conceptual
	framework through which we outline the core elements and features
	required by agents engaged in argumentation-based negotiation, as
	well as the environment that hosts these agents. For each of these
	elements, we survey and evaluate existing proposed techniques in
	the literature and highlight the major challenges that need to be
	addressed if argument-based negotiation research is to reach its
	full potential. },

  note = {Argumentation in Artificial Intelligence},
  abstract = {Negotiation is a fundamental interaction mechanism in multi-agent
	systems because it allows self-interested agents to come to mutually
	beneficial agreements and partition resources efficiently and effectively.
	Now, in many situations, the agents need to negotiate with one another
	many times and so developing strategies that are effective over repeated
	interactions is an important challenge. Against this background,
	a growing body of work has examined the use of Persuasive Negotiation
	(PN), which involves negotiating using rhetorical arguments (such
	as threats, rewards, or appeals), in trying to convince an opponent
	to accept a given offer. Such mechanisms are especially suited to
	repeated encounters because they allow agents to influence the outcomes
	of future negotiations, while negotiating a deal in the present one,
	with the aim of producing results that are beneficial to both parties.
	To this end, in this paper, we develop a comprehensive PN mechanism
	for repeated interactions that makes use of rewards that can be asked
	for or given to. Our mechanism consists of two parts. First, a novel
	protocol that structures the interaction by capturing the commitments
	that agents incur when using rewards. Second, a new reward generation
	algorithm that constructs promises of rewards in future interactions
	as a means of permitting agents to reach better agreements, in a
	shorter time, in the present encounter. We then go on to develop
	a specific negotiation tactic, based on this reward generation algorithm,
	and show that it can achieve significantly better outcomes than existing
	benchmark tactics that do not use such inducements. Specifically,
	we show, via empirical evaluation in a Multi-Move Prisoners' Dilemma
	setting, that our tactic can lead to a 26% improvement in the utility
	of deals that are made and that 21 times fewer messages need to be
	exchanged in order to achieve this.},

	actions they can increase the chances that one of the team members

	the problem that the team members face, when they attempt to recognise
	one another within the noisy {IPD} tournament, is exactly analogous
	to the problem, studied in information theory, of communicating reliably
	over a noisy channel. Thus we demonstrate that we can use error-correcting

	the performance of the team.},

abstract = {A negotiation team is a set of agents with common and possibly also conflicting preferences that forms one of the parties of a negotiation. A negotiation team is involved in two decision making processes simultaneously, a negotiation with the opponents, and an intra-team process to decide on the moves to make in the negotiation. This article focuses on negotiation team decision making for circumstances that require unanimity of team decisions. Existing agent-based approaches only guarantee unanimity in teams negotiating in domains exclusively composed of predictable and compatible issues. This article presents a model for negotiation teams that guarantees unanimous team decisions in domains consisting of predictable and compatible, and alsounpredictable issues. Moreover, the article explores the influence of using opponent, and team member models in the proposing strategies that team members use. Experimental results show that the team benefits if team members employ Bayesian learning to model their teammates' preferences.},

  abstract = {Ambient Intelligence aims to offer personalized services and easier
	ways of interaction between people and systems. Since several users
	and systems may coexist in these environments, it is quite possible
	that entities with opposing preferences need to cooperate to reach
	their respective goals. Automated negotiation is pointed as one of
	the mechanisms that may provide a solution to this kind of problems.
	In this article, a multi-issue bilateral bargaining model for Ambient
	Intelligence domains is presented where it is assumed that agents
	have computational bounded resources and do not know their opponents'
	preferences. The main goal of this work is to provide negotiation
	models that obtain efficient agreements while maintaining the computational
	cost low. A niching genetic algorithm is used before the negotiation
	process to sample one's own utility function (self-sampling). During
	the negotiation process, genetic operators are applied over the opponent's
	and one's own offers in order to sample new offers that are interesting
	for both parties. Results show that the proposed model is capable
	of outperforming similarity heuristics which only sample before the
	negotiation process and of obtaining similar results to similarity
	heuristics which have access to all of the possible offers. },

	device by means of a simple bargaining model with one-sided incomplete
	information: Limited conflicts reveal information about the outcome
	of the all-out conflict (that ends the game) because the outcomes
	of both types of confrontations are driven by the relative strength
	of the parties. We limit the analysis to the case where the uninformed
	party can learn the information transmitted in the battlefield but
	not the one conveyed by offers. The game becomes then an optimal
	stopping problem where the informed party has to decide at each period
	whether to stop, by reaching an agreement or by invoking total conflict,
	or to keep fighting. We show that conflict is a double-edge sword:
	It may paradoxically open the door to agreement when the uniformed
	party is too optimistic. But confrontation also occurs when agreement
	is possible but the informed agent has incentives to improve her
	bargaining position by fighting.},

  abstract = {Task execution in multi-agent environments may require cooperation
	among agents. Given a set of agents and a set of tasks which they
	have to satisfy, we consider situations where each task should be
	attached to a group of agents that will perform the task. Task allocation
	to groups of agents is necessary when tasks cannot be performed by
	a single agent. However it may also be beneficial when groups perform
	more efficiently with respect to the single agents' performance.
	In this paper we present several solutions to the problem of task
	allocation among autonomous agents, and suggest that the agents form
	coalitions in order to perform tasks or improve the efficiency of
	their performance. We present efficient distributed algorithms with
	low ratio bounds and with low computational complexities. These properties
	are proven theoretically and supported by simulations and an implementation
	in an agent system. Our methods are based on both the algorithmic
	aspects of combinatorics and approximation algorithms for NP-hard
	problems. We first present an approach to agent coalition formation
	where each agent must be a member of only one coalition. Next, we
	present the domain of overlapping coalitions. We proceed with a discussion
	of the domain where tasks may have a precedence order. Finally, we
	discuss the case of implementation in an open, dynamic agent system.
	For each case we provide an algorithm that will lead agents to the
	formation of coalitions, where each coalition is assigned a task.
	Our algorithms are any-time algorithms, they are simple, efficient
	and easy to implement. },

  abstract = {In basketball, every time the offense produces a shot opportunity
	the player with the ball must decide whether the shot is worth taking.
	In this article, I explore the question of when a team should shoot
	and when they should pass up the shot by considering a simple theoretical
	model of the shot selection process, in which the quality of shot
	opportunities generated by the offense is assumed to fall randomly
	within a uniform distribution. Within this model I derive an answer
	to the question how likely must the shot be to go in before the player
	should take it? and I show that this lower cutoff for shot quality

year = {1999},
institution = {EconWPA},
type = {Experimental},
abstract = {The results of Ultimatum Game experiments are often quoted as evidence for the role of fairness in bargaining or in economic behaviour more generally. This paper argues that the observed fairness levels are contingent on the traditional experimental design where players are newly matched each round, and reputations are therefore excluded. Evidence from a new experiment shows that average behaviour is more competitive and conflict rates are higher when subjects play against the same opponent repeatedly. This finding is not expected by the traditional fairness hypothesis. A detailed analysis of the dynamics of pairs of players shows that different types of players coexist in the subject pool. Whereas previous experiments found evidence for the existence of fair players, the present study reports also a significant number of tough players. Hence, there is evidence that allowing for reputations in repeated ultimatum bargaining induces different patterns of behaviour that have not been observed before in this game.},

  volume = {10},
  pages = {121 - 136},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Because negotiation and conflict resolution are complex and unstructured
	tasks, they need sophisticated decision support. One of the crucial
	characteristics of such support is systems that are capable of improving
	their performance, both in terms of efficiency and solution quality,
	by employing machine learning techniques. A framework for intelligent
	computer-supported conflict resolution through negotiation/ mediation
	is presented. The model integrates Artificial Intelligence methods
	(case-based reasoning) and decision theoretic techniques (multi-attribute
	utilities) to provide enhanced conflict resolution and negotiation
	support in group problem solving. This model has been implemented
	in the PERSUADER, a computer program which operates in the domain
	of resolution of labor management disputes. The PERSUADER uses case-based
	reasoning (CBR) to learn from its experience. In contrast to quantitative
	models or expert systems that solve each problem from scratch and
	discard the solution at the end of problem solving, CBR retains the
	process and results of its computational decisions so that they can
	be re-used to solve future related problems. CBR is a powerful learning
	method since it enables a system not only to exploit previous succesful
	decisions, thus short-cutting possibly long reasoning chains, but
	also to profit from previous failures by using them to recognize
	similar failures in advance so they can be avoided in the future.
	As the state of the art in DSS development advances and as DSSs support
	increasingly more complicated tasks, such machine learning techniques
	will become an indispensable part of decision support systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a novel bidding strategy that autonomous
	trading agents can use to participate in Continuous Double Auctions
	(CDAs). Our strategy is based on both short and long-term learning
	that allows such agents to adapt their bidding behaviour to be efficient
	in a wide variety of environments. For the short-term learning, the
	agent updates the aggressiveness of its bidding behaviour (more aggressive
	means it will trade off profit to improve its chance of transacting,
	less aggressive that it targets more profitable transactions and
	is willing to trade off its chance of transacting to achieve them)
	based on market information observed after any bid or ask appears
	in the market. The long-term learning then determines how this aggressiveness
	factor influences an agent's choice of which bids or asks to submit
	in the market, and is based on market information observed after
	every transaction (successfully matched bid and ask). The principal
	motivation for the short-term learning is to enable the agent to
	immediately respond to market fluctuations, while for the long-term
	learning it is to adapt to broader trends in the way in which the
	market demand and supply changes over time. We benchmark our strategy
	against the current state of the art (ZIP and GDX) and show that
	it outperforms these benchmarks in both static and dynamic environments.
	This is true both when the population is homogeneous (where the increase
	in efficiency is up to 5.2%) and heterogeneous (in which case there
	is a 0.85 probability of our strategy being adopted in a two-population
	evolutionary game theoretic analysis). },

  title = {Practical Strategies for Agent-Based Negotiation in Complex Environments},
  school = {University of Southampton},
  year = {2012},
  month = {Dec},
  abstract = {Agent-based negotiation, whereby the negotiation is automated by software
	programs, can be applied to many different negotiation situations,
	including negotiations between friends, businesses or countries.
	A key benefit of agent-based negotiation over human negotiation is
	that it can be used to negotiate effectively in complex negotiation
	environments, which consist of multiple negotiation issues, time
	constraints, and multiple unknown opponents. While automated negotiation
	has been an active area of research in the past twenty years, existing
	work has a number of limitations. Specifically, most of the existing
	literature has considered time constraints in terms of the number
	of rounds of negotiation that take place. In contrast, in this work
	we consider time constraints which are based on the amount of time
	that has elapsed. This requires a different approach, since the time
	spent computing the next action has an effect on the utility of the
	outcome, whereas the actual number of offers exchanged does not.
	In addition to these time constraints, in the complex negotiation
	environments which we consider, there are multiple negotiation issues,
	and we assume that the opponents? preferences over these issues and
	the behaviour of those opponents are unknown. Finally, in our environment
	there can be concurrent negotiations between many participants.
	
	Against this background, in this thesis we present the design of a
	range of practical negotiation strategies, the most advanced of which
	uses Gaussian process regression to coordinate its concession against
	its various opponents, whilst considering the behaviour of those
	opponents and the time constraints. In more detail, the strategy
	uses observations of the offers made by each opponent to predict
	the future concession of that opponent. By considering the discounting
	factor, it predicts the future time which maximises the utility of
	the offers, and we then use this in setting our rate of concession.
	Furthermore, we evaluate the negotiation agents that we have developed,
	which use our strategies, and show that, particularly in the more
	challenging scenarios, our most advanced strategy outperforms other
	state-of-the-art agents from the Automated Negotiating Agent Competition,
	which provides an international benchmark for this work. In more
	detail, our results show that, in one-to-one negotiation, in the
	highly discounted scenarios, our agent reaches outcomes which, on
	average, are 2.3\% higher than those of the next best agent.
	
	Furthermore, using empirical game theoretic analysis we show the robustness
	of our strategy in a variety of tournament settings. This analysis
	shows that, in the highly discounted scenarios, no agent can benefit
	by choosing a different strategy (taken from the top four strategies
	in that setting) than ours. Finally, in the many-to-many negotiations,
	we show how our strategy is particularly effective in highly competitive
	scenarios, where it outperforms the state-of-the-art many-to-many
	negotiation strategy by up to 45\%.},

abstract = "Abstract Multi-item negotiations surround our daily life and usually involve two parties that share common or conflicting interests. Effective automated negotiation techniques should enable the agents to adaptively adjust their behaviors depending on the characteristics of their negotiating partners and negotiation scenarios. This is complicated by the fact that the negotiation agents are usually unwilling to reveal their information (strategies and preferences) to avoid being exploited during negotiation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive negotiation strategy, called ABiNeS, which can make effective negotiations against different types of negotiating partners. The {ABiNeS} strategy employs the non-exploitation point to adaptively adjust the appropriate time to stop exploiting the negotiating partner and also predicts the optimal offer for the negotiating partner based on the reinforcement-learning based approach. Simulation results show that the {ABiNeS} strategy can perform more efficient exploitations against different types of negotiating partners, and thus achieve higher overall payoffs compared with the state-of-the-art strategies under negotiation tournaments. We also provide a detailed analysis of why the {ABiNeS} strategy can negotiate more efficiently compared with other existing state-of-the-art negotiation strategies focusing on two major components. Lastly, we propose adopting the single-agent best deviation principle to analyze the robustness of different negotiation strategies based on model checking techniques. Through our analysis, the {ABiNeS} strategy is shown to be very robust against other state-of-the-art strategies under different negotiation contexts. "

	so, we develop the first principled approach that enables the coordination
	of multiple, concurrent negotiation threads for practical negotiation
	settings. Furthermore, we validate our strategy using the agents
	and domains developed for the International Automated Negotiating
	Agents Competition (ANAC), and we benchmark our strategy against
	the state-of-the-art. We find that our approach significantly outperforms
	existing approaches, and this difference improves even further as

  abstract = {In final-offer arbitration the two parties to a dispute submit final
	offers to an arbitrator. The arbitrator then chooses as the binding
	solution that offer which is closest to his own view of the appropriate

	arbitrator's preferences, final-offer arbitration can be modeled
	as a game of imperfect information. Interesting questions arise concerning
	the nature of the optimal strategies and how they are affected by
	different characteristics of the arbitrator and the disputants. We
	provide conditions for an equilibrium to exist in a final-offer arbitration
	game when there are k issues, the probability function is not specified
	and the disputants are either risk averse or risk neutral. Furthermore,
	the players may have differing beliefs about the arbitrator's probability
	function. We demonstrate that increased risk aversion by one of the
	parties will result in both players choosing positions farther away
	from the more risk averse party. We also discover the affect of bias
	(as well as the effect of increased sensitivity) by the arbitrator
	on the positions taken by the players.},

abstract = "Negotiation has been extensively discussed in game-theoretic, economic and management science literatures for decades. Recent growing interest in autonomous interacting software agents and their potential application in areas such as electronic commerce has give increased importance to automated negotiation. Evidence both from theoretical analysis and from observations of human interactions suggests that if decision makers can somehow take into consideration what other agents are thinking and furthermore learn during their interactions how other agents behave, their payoff might increase. In this paper, we propose a sequential decision-making model of negotiation, called Bazaar. It provides an adaptive, multi-issue negotiation model capable of exhibiting a rich set of negotiation behaviors. Within the proposed negotiation framework, we model learning as a Bayesian belief update process. In this paper, we present both theoretical analysis and initial experimental results showing that learning is beneficial in the sequential negotiation model. "

  abstract = {The authors present a theoretical negotiation model for rational agents
	in general noncooperative domains. Necessary and sufficient conditions
	for cooperation are outlined. By redefining the concept of utility,
	it is possible to enlarge the number of situations that have a cooperative
	solution. An approach is offered for conflict resolution, and it
	is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial cooperative steps
	can be taken by interacting agents. A unified negotiation protocol
	is developed that can be used in all cases. It is shown that in certain
	borderline cooperative situations, a partial cooperative agreement
	might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational
	agreement that would achieve all their goals. A deal hierarchy is
	presented that captures the partial order among various kinds of
	deals between agents. The multiplan deal, which involves negotiating
	over a pair of joint plans simultaneously, allows cooperative agreement
	and conflict resolution in both fixed goal and flexible goal domains},

abstract={In this paper we empirically investigate the feasibility of using peer-designed agents (PDAs) instead of people for the purpose of mechanism evaluation. This latter approach has been increasingly advocated in agent research in recent years, mainly due to its many benefits in terms of time and cost. Our experiments compare the behavior of 31 PDAs and 150 people in a legacy eCommerce-based price-exploration setting, using different price-setting mechanisms and different performance measures. The results show a varying level of similarity between the aggregate behavior obtained when using people and when using PDAs -- in some settings similar results were obtained, in others the use of PDAs rather than people yields substantial differences. This suggests that the ability to generalize results from one successful implementation of PDA-based systems to another, regarding the use of PDAs as a substitute to people in systems evaluation, is quite limited. The decision to prefer PDAs for mechanism evaluation is therefore setting dependent and the applicability of the approach must be re-evaluated whenever switching to a new setting or using a different measure. Furthermore, we show that even in settings where the aggregate behavior is found to be similar, the individual strategies used by agents in each group highly vary.},

This way, a complex design problem is partitioned into a number of more manageable subproblems that are addressed in separate layers. This paper discusses vehicle control requirements and maps them onto layered control architecture. The formalization of the hierarchy is accomplished in terms of the specific functions accomplished by each layer and of the interfaces between layers. The implementation of the layers is discussed and illustrative examples are provided.},

The value of the search should determine the seller's bottom-line or reservation price in dealings with a prospective buyer. Optimal search and stopping theory suggest useful procedures and heuristics for evaluating one's reservation price in negotiation and for searching among alternatives.},

  abstract = {Agent negotiation is a form of decision making where two or more agents jointly search for a mutually agreed solution to a certain problem. In multi-issue negotiation, with information available about the agents' preferences, a negotiation may result in a mutually beneficial agreement. In a competitive negotiation environment, however, self-interested agents may not be willing to reveal their preferences, and this can increase the difficulty of negotiating a mutually beneficial agreement. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a Bayesian-based approach which can help an agent to predict its opponent's preference in bilateral multi-issue negotiation. The proposed approach employs Bayesian theory to analyse the opponent's historical offers and to approximately predict the opponent's preference over negotiation issues. A counter-offer proposition algorithm is also integrated into the prediction approach to help agents to propose mutually beneficial offers based on the prediction results. Experimental results indicate good performance of the proposed approach in terms of utility gain and negotiation efficiency.},

abstract = "Abstract Multi-item negotiations surround our daily life and usually involve two parties that share common or conflicting interests. Effective automated negotiation techniques should enable the agents to adaptively adjust their behaviors depending on the characteristics of their negotiating partners and negotiation scenarios. This is complicated by the fact that the negotiation agents are usually unwilling to reveal their information (strategies and preferences) to avoid being exploited during negotiation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive negotiation strategy, called ABiNeS, which can make effective negotiations against different types of negotiating partners. The \{ABiNeS\} strategy employs the non-exploitation point to adaptively adjust the appropriate time to stop exploiting the negotiating partner and also predicts the optimal offer for the negotiating partner based on the reinforcement-learning based approach. Simulation results show that the \{ABiNeS\} strategy can perform more efficient exploitations against different types of negotiating partners, and thus achieve higher overall payoffs compared with the state-of-the-art strategies under negotiation tournaments. We also provide a detailed analysis of why the \{ABiNeS\} strategy can negotiate more efficiently compared with other existing state-of-the-art negotiation strategies focusing on two major components. Lastly, we propose adopting the single-agent best deviation principle to analyze the robustness of different negotiation strategies based on model checking techniques. Through our analysis, the \{ABiNeS\} strategy is shown to be very robust against other state-of-the-art strategies under different negotiation contexts. "

The Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) is a rich competitive simulation of future retail power markets. This simulation will help us to understand the dynamics of customer and retailer decision-making and the robustness of market designs, by stimulating researchers to develop broker agents and benchmark them against each other. This will provide compelling, actionable information for policymakers and industry leaders. We describe the competition scenario in detail, and we demonstrate behaviors that arise from the interaction of customer and broker models. },

An automated negotiation is needed to establish customized SLAs between service providers and consumers with no previous knowledge of each other. Traditional negotiations between humans are often fraught with difficulty. Thus, in this work, the use of intelligent agents to represent cloud providers and consumers is advocated. Rubinstein's Alternating Offers Protocol offers a suitable technical solution for this challenging problem. The purpose of this paper is to apply the state-of-the-art in negotiation automated algorithms/agents within a described Cloud Computing SLA framework, and to evaluate the most appropriate negotiation approach based on many criteria.},

  abstract  = {Bilateral multi-issue closed negotiation is an important class for real-life negotiations. Usually, negotiation problems have constraints such as a complex and unknown opponent's utility in real time, or time discounting. In the class of negotiation with some constraints, the effective automated negotiation agents can adjust their behavior depending on the characteristics of their opponents and negotiation scenarios. Recently, the attention of this study has focused on the interleaving learning with negotiation strategies from the past negotiation sessions. By analyzing the past negotiation sessions, agents can estimate the opponent's utility function based on exchanging bids. In this paper, we propose an automated agent that estimates the opponent's strategies based on the past negotiation sessions. Our agent tries to compromise to the estimated maximum utility of the opponent by the end of the negotiation. In addition, our agent can adjust the speed of compromise by judging the opponent's Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode and search for the pareto frontier using past negotiation sessions. In the experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed agent has better outcomes and greater search technique for the pareto frontier than existing agents in the linear and nonlinear utility functions.},

  abstract = {Abstract In automated bilateral multi issue negotiations, two intelligent automated agents negotiate on behalf of their owners regarding many issues in order to reach an agreement. Modeling the opponent can excessively boost the performance of the agents and increase the quality of the negotiation outcome. State of the art models accomplish this by considering some assumptions about the opponent which restricts the applicability of the models in real scenarios. In this study, a less restricted technique where perceptron units (POPPONENT) are applied in modeling the preferences of the opponent is proposed. This model adopts the Multi Bipartite version of the Standard Gradient Descent search algorithm (MBGD) to find the best hypothesis, which is the best preference profile. In order to evaluate the accuracy and performance of this proposed opponent model, it is compared with the state of the art models available in the Genius repository. This results in the devised setting which approves the higher accuracy of \{POPPONENT\} compared to the most accurate state of the art model. Evaluating the model in the real world negotiation scenarios in the Genius framework also confirms its high accuracy in relation to the state of the art models in estimating the utility of offers. The findings here indicate that this proposed model is individually and socially efficient. This proposed \{MBGD\} method could also be adopted in other practical areas of Artificial Intelligence. },

In developing such algorithms the main focus has been on their efficiency and their effectiveness. However, this is only a part of the picture. Typically, agents negotiate on behalf of their owners and for this to be effective the agents must be able to adequately represent their owners? strategies and preferences for negotiation. However, the process by which such knowledge is acquired is typically left unspecified. To address this problem, we undertook a study of how user information about negotiation tradeoff strategies and preferences can be captured. Specifically, we devised a novel default-then-adjust acquisition technique. In this, the system firstly does a structured interview with the user to suggest the attributes that the tradeoff could be made between, then it asks the user to adjust the suggested default tradeoff strategy by improving some attribute to see how much worse the attribute being traded off can be made while still being acceptable, and, finally, it asks the user to adjust the default preference on the tradeoff alternatives. This method is consistent with the principles of standard negotiation theory and to demonstrate its effectiveness we implemented a prototype system and performed an empirical evaluation in an accommodation renting scenario. The result of this evaluation indicates the proposed technique is helpful and efficient in accurately acquiring the users? tradeoff strategies and preferences.}

The data collected by IoT products and solutions are expected to be traded in these markets. Data owners will collect data using IoT products and solutions. Data consumers who are interested will negotiate with the data owners to get access to such data. Data captured by IoT products will allow data consumers to further understand the preferences and behaviors of data owners and to generate additional business value using techniques ranging from waste reduction to personalized service offerings. In open data markets, data consumers will be able to give back part of the additional value generated to the data owners. However, privacy becomes a significant issue when data that can be used to derive extremely personal information is being traded. This article discusses why privacy matters in the IoT domain in general and especially in open data markets, and then surveys existing privacy-preserving strategies and design techniques that can be used to facilitate end-to-end privacy for open data markets.

abstract = "We present a new method, called UTAGMS, for multiple criteria ranking of alternatives from set A using a set of additive value functions which result from an ordinal regression. The preference information provided by the decision maker is a set of pairwise comparisons on a subset of alternatives ARA, called reference alternatives. The preference model built via ordinal regression is the set of all additive value functions compatible with the preference information. Using this model, one can define two relations in the set A: the necessary weak preference relation which holds for any two alternatives a, b from set A if and only if for all compatible value functions a is preferred to b, and the possible weak preference relation which holds for this pair if and only if for at least one compatible value function a is preferred to b. These relations establish a necessary and a possible ranking of alternatives from A, being, respectively, a partial preorder and a strongly complete relation. The UTAGMS method is intended to be used interactively, with an increasing subset AR and a progressive statement of pairwise comparisons. When no preference information is provided, the necessary weak preference relation is a weak dominance relation, and the possible weak preference relation is a complete relation. Every new pairwise comparison of reference alternatives, for which the dominance relation does not hold, is enriching the necessary relation and it is impoverishing the possible relation, so that they converge with the growth of the preference information. Distinguishing necessary and possible consequences of preference information on the complete set of actions, UTAGMS answers questions of robustness analysis. Moreover, the method can support the decision maker when his/her preference statements cannot be represented in terms of an additive value function. The method is illustrated by an example solved using the UTAGMS software. Some extensions of the method are also presented."

abstract="Groups engaged in a mutual activity often need assistance in order to reach a joint decision. However, the group members' personal preferences are often unknown and need to be collected. Querying for preferences can annoy the users. We suggest employing a voting mechanism that finds a winning item under incomplete settings. We present a practical method for eliciting the preferences, so that with a minimal amount of queries a winning item that certainly suits the group can be computed. The heuristic incorporates probabilistic assumptions on the users' preferences and was evaluated on a real world datasets as well as on simulated data, showing a saving in queries to users.",

abstract = "Abstract Conflict is an inevitable part of both knowledge elicitation and system design. People will disagree over how to interpret features of the application domain, what the requirements for a new system are, and how to meet those requirements. Conventional systems analysis techniques avoid such conflicts, making any resolution untraceable and adding to the communication problems. This paper surveys a number of fields which have addressed the problems of conflict resolution. A model of computer-supported negotiation is presented which can be used to address conflicts in systems analysis directly. The model begins with an exploratory phase, in which the conflict is broken down into its components, eliciting the issues which underlie disagreements and criteria to measure their satisfaction. A set of options for possible resolutions are generated using design techniques. Finally, these options are compared to the original issues, and evaluated according to the criteria associated with the issues. The model emphasizes communication, and encourages investigation of other viewpoints. The model has been used to develop a system called Synoptic, which provides a set of tools to support the exploration of conflicts."

abstract="Negotiation with multiple interdependent issues is an important problem since much of real-world negotiation falls into this category. This paper examines the problem that, in such domains, agent utility functions are nonlinear, and thereby can create nonconvex Pareto frontiers. This in turn implies that the Nash Bargaining Solution, which has been viewed as the gold standard for identifying a unique optimal negotiation outcome, does not serve that role in nonlinear domains. In nonlinear domains, unlike linear ones, there can be multiple Nash Bargaining Solutions, and all can be sub-optimal with respect to social welfare and fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel negotiation protocol called SFMP (the Secure and Fair Mediator Protocol) that addresses this challenge, enabling secure multilateral negotiations with fair and pareto-optimal outcomes in nonlinear domains. The protocol works by (1) using nonlinear optimization, combined with a Multi-Party protocol, to find the Pareto front without revealing agent's private utility information, and (2) selecting the agreement from the Pareto set that maximizes a fair division criterion we call approximated fairness. We demonstrate that SFMP is able to find agreements that maximize fairness and social welfare in nonlinear domains, and out-performs (in terms of outcomes and scalability) previously developed nonlinear negotiation protocols.",
